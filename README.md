# Cipher - An electron based downloader - Because why not
The cipher client is intended to make it easy for you to download encrypted links. This allows for people
to post links online without the end user ever having to know where the download is coming from, just what
the file is and how big it is.

## Getting Started

Download directory hardcoded on line 121 of /js/ElementHandler.js, this will be changed in the future once a settings
panel is provided but as of now you must manually input the directory

There is no exit button, you must close it manually via stoppingits process, ^c on the node command line, or close it via
the taskbar

Probably a lot of other problems I'm not mentioning right now but whatever this is a WIP project for sure
